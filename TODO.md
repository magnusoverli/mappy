## Completed Plans

### âœ… Layer Context Menu Removal (`/plans/completed/layer-context-menu-removal.md`)
Successfully removed context menu and added red delete button next to "Add Layer" button. Simplified UX, better discoverability, reduced code complexity.

### âœ… Entry Edit Modal Field Borders (`/plans/completed/entry-edit-modal-field-borders.md`)
Added subtle borders around editable fields in EntryEditModal with hover and focus states. Improved UX by making editable fields clearly distinguishable while maintaining clean aesthetic.

### âœ… Search Optimization (`/plans/completed/search-optimization.md`)
Comprehensive search performance optimization with 2-5x improvements across 4 milestones: duplicate string storage removal (50% memory reduction), consolidated useMemo hooks (200% performance improvement), incremental index updates (300% speed improvement), and Web Workers for large datasets (500% speed improvement).

### âœ… Entry Editor Transformation Button Fix (`/plans/completed/entry-editor-button-fix.md`)
Fixed "Apply to X entries" transformation button that never activated due to case sensitivity bug. Updated hex validation regex to support both uppercase and lowercase hex digits.

### âœ… Entry Field Editing Fix (`/plans/completed/entry-field-editing-fix.md`)
Fixed TextField editing that immediately deactivated when clicking on fields in EntryEditModal. Added event handlers to prevent TextField event bubbling to row selection handlers.

### âœ… Planning System Sync Fix (`/plans/completed/planning-system-sync-fix.md`)
Fixed plans not being properly archived when completed and TODO.md/plan files being out of sync. Implemented automated sync tools, improved validation, and consistent metadata format.

### âœ… Reset Button Freeze Fix (`/plans/completed/reset-button-freeze-fix.md`)
Fixed reset button causing browser tab to freeze and become unresponsive. Added reset-specific optimization to bypass expensive change detection when clearing all data.

### âœ… File Upload Reset Bug (`/plans/completed/fileupload-reset-bug.md`)
Fixed file input not triggering second onChange after reset. Clear the file input's value after file selection.
