- **Description**: Optimize list implementations and create reusable components to eliminate code duplication and improve performance
- **Goal**: Unified BaseList component, improved LayerList width calculation performance, and consistent interaction patterns across all lists



### üé® Entry Field Editability Improvements (`/plans/completed/entry-field-editability-improvements.md`)
- **Priority**: Medium | **Assignee**: @opencode
- **Status**: Completed
- **Description**: Replace bordered text fields with modern hover-reveal pattern or subtle visual cues to improve both visual design and user understanding of field editability

### üé® Large Centered Modal UI Enhancement (`/plans/completed/large-centered-modal-ui.md`)
- **Priority**: High | **Assignee**: @opencode
- **Status**: Completed
- **Enhancement**: Transform fullscreen modal to large centered modal (75% width, 85% height) with blurred background, smooth animations, and multiple exit methods
- **Goal**: Improve visual focus, better content proportions, clear context boundaries, and enhanced readability while preserving all functionality



### ‚úÖ Layer Context Menu Removal
Successfully removed context menu and added red delete button next to "Add Layer" button. Simplified UX, better discoverability, reduced code complexity.

### ‚úÖ Entry Edit Modal Field Borders
Added subtle borders around editable fields in EntryEditModal with hover and focus states. Improved UX by making editable fields clearly distinguishable while maintaining clean aesthetic.

### ‚úÖ Search Optimization
Comprehensive search performance optimization with 2-5x improvements across 4 milestones: duplicate string storage removal (50% memory reduction), consolidated useMemo hooks (200% performance improvement), incremental index updates (300% speed improvement), and Web Workers for large datasets (500% speed improvement).

### ‚úÖ Entry Editor Transformation Button Fix
Fixed "Apply to X entries" transformation button that never activated due to case sensitivity bug. Updated hex validation regex to support both uppercase and lowercase hex digits.

### ‚úÖ Entry Field Editing Fix
Fixed TextField editing that immediately deactivated when clicking on fields in EntryEditModal. Added event handlers to prevent TextField event bubbling to row selection handlers.

### ‚úÖ Planning System Sync Fix
Fixed plans not being properly archived when completed and TODO.md/plan files being out of sync. Implemented automated sync tools, improved validation, and consistent metadata format.

### ‚úÖ Reset Button Freeze Fix
Fixed reset button causing browser tab to freeze and become unresponsive. Added reset-specific optimization to bypass expensive change detection when clearing all data.

### ‚úÖ File Upload Reset Bug
Fixed file input not triggering second onChange after reset. Clear the file input's value after file selection.
